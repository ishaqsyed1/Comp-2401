Project: Bit Manipulation: The project is designed to simulate transmitting and receiving a message over the network. The program will flip bits to act as errors and then demonstrate how to correct them.

1. Extract files to one folder
2. Using the command line, access that folder.
3. Compile the first program with "gcc –o tran transmit.c bit_manipulation.c"
4. Run the first program with "./a.out"
5. Compile the second program with "gcc –o recv receive.c bit_manipulation.c"
6. Run the second program with "./a.out"
