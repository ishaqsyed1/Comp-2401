The program has 2 .c files, 2 .h files, and 4 .o files.

The following steps explain how to compile and run the file...
1. Open the terminal and locate the assignment4 folder using 'cd'.
2. Use 'make main_test' to compile the files.
3. Use './main_test' to run the program after you've compiled.
4. Done! The program should be up and running.

This program is very open, and will function with any linked list. The testing program that the prof has handed out will work fine.

This program is not meant to work standalone. It requires linked lists to be sent to the functions(testing programs). You have many options for manipulation of linked lists. You can delete nodes, search by name, print the nodes, count elements etc.
